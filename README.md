# Deep_Learning_Schoool_MFTI_Part1_2025

This repository contains materials for **Part 1: Intro to Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Computer Vision)**.

The course introduces core concepts of machine learning, neural networks, and their application to real-world computer vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and generative modeling.
It combines **theoretical lectures** with **hands-on practical sessions**.

## Technologies and Tools

Throughout the course, neural network models are implemented using **PyTorch**.
Additional widely used libraries include:

* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* and other supporting Python tools

Practical work is carried out using **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Google Colab**, and **Yandex DataSphere**.

## Course Structure

The course consists of **12 modules** grouped into **three main blocks**:

1. **Data Processing and Classical Machine Learning** (Modules 1–4)
2. **Introduction to Neural Networks** (Modules 5–7)
3. **Neural Networks for Computer Vision** (Modules 8–12)
